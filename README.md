# Re-analysis of Gut Microbiota in Untreated DLBCL Patients
This repository contains all materials for a re-analysis of gut microbiome data from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients and healthy controls, using an updated analysis pipeline. It includes: <br>
R script (.R) file – All code used for statistical analyses, diversity metrics, and visualizations.<br>
QIIME 2 terminal commands – The pipeline used for processing raw sequencing data, generating ASVs, and performing taxonomic assignment and diversity analyses.<br>
Manuscript – The full paper detailing study design, methods, results, and conclusions.<br>
This repository provides full reproducibility for the updated analysis, demonstrating how modern metagenomic pipelines can alter interpretations compared to the original study.<br>
